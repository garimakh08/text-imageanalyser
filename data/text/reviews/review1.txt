Amazon is selling the product on its app.

The delivery of the product was not made. But, the replacement cooker was taken back by the delivery agent in January 2023.

This is theft and Amazon is co-party to theft and has not even bothered for 6 months to resolve the issue after repeated reminders.

This kind of passing the bucket is only done in India as consumer courts in USA would levy a very hefty penalty for such theft at customer end.

An Indian customer does not deserve such unfair treatment.

I am a regular buyer and I have to run pillar to post with Amazon to sort out an issue worth less than 2000 Rs.

This shows the level of customer service in India.

On the other hand, Amazon USA had always been wonderful for the time I stayed in USA from 2017 to 2022.

Very poor company culture in India to take customers so lightly.
